# Algorithm Challenge #2 – Sum of Each Row in a 3x3 Matrix (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program fills a 3x3 matrix with random numbers, prints the matrix, and then calculates and displays the sum of each row.

This challenge emphasizes understanding how to traverse a matrix row by row and apply aggregation logic in a clean and structured way.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Traversing 2D arrays (matrices)
- Calculating row-based aggregates
- Passing matrices to functions
- Applying decomposition and modular design
- Writing clean, readable C++ code
- Strengthening algorithmic thinking (Level 3)

---

🧩 Example Output
-
The following is a 3x3 Random Matrix:

 12   45   30  
  8   19   67  
 22   14   10  

The following are the sums of each row in the matrix:

Row 1 Sum = 87  
Row 2 Sum = 94  
Row 3 Sum = 46
